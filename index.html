          <h1>How do you set up at HTML File?</h1>
          <div>In order to let the web browser know we are using HTML we must start out document with a document type declaration that looks like this: </div>
          <div><strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong></div>
          <div>This declaration provides the browser with 2 pieces of information:</div>
          <ol>
            <li>The type of document</li>
            <li>the HTML version to expect</li>
          </ol>
          <div>The declaration doesn't actuallly add any HTML structure or content.</div>
          <p>This must be the first line of code in your HTML document.
            Currently, HTML5 is the most up to date version, but in the future once a new standard has overtaken version 5, beginning with the declaration will make sure that your document is forever interpreted correctly.
            
            Lastly, HTML code always saves in a file with a .html extension.
            
            After you write the declaration, then anything between the &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; will be interpreted as HTML code.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="head">
            <h1>The Head Element</h1>
            <div>The head element goes above the body element of an html document.  It contains metador for a web page.  Metadata is info about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page. 
            </div>
            <div>A browser's tab displays the title specified in the title tag.  The title tag is always inside of the head tag.</div>
        </section>
        <section id="anchor">
            <h1>The Anchor Tag</h1>
            <div>You can add links to another web page by adding the anchor element and including the text of the link between the opening and closing tags.</div>
            <div>An anchor tag must have and <strong>href</strong> attribute (hyperlink reference) 
                Here's and example:</div>
            <p><strong>&lt;a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"&gt;This Is A Link To Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;</strong></p>
            <p>would display as this: <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">This Is A Link to Wikipedia</a></p>
            <p>Another attribute of the anchor tag in the <strong>target</strong> attribute. The target attribute specifies how a link should open.
                <strong>target="_blank"</strong> to open the link in a new window.
                Leaving out the target attribute will open the link in the same window.</p>
            <p>Here is the same link with a target attribute: <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">This Is A Link to Wikipedia</a></p>
            <h3>When wanting to link to other pages in a static website:</h3>
            <p>Usually web developers store HTML files in the root directory or a main folder where all the files for a project are stored.
                For example let's say that we had this file structure:
            </p>
            <div>project-folder/</div>
            <ul>
                <li>about.html</li>
                <li>contact.html</li>
                <li>index.html</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We can link web pages together using a relative path (shows the path to a local file or a file on the same website. An absolute path is a full url</p>
            <p>Let's say that we are on the index.html and we want to go to the contact page.</p>
            <div><strong>&lt;a href="./contact.html"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;</strong> (would show up as contact underlined as a link)</div>
            <p>The ./ tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder</p>
            <h3>Images as a link</h3>
            <p>You can turn an image into a link by wrapping the image tag in anchor tags</p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_recluse_spider"><img src="https://www.mercy.net/content/dam/mercy/en/images/News/brown-recluse-spider-2019.jpeg.transform/image-component-desktop/img.jpeg" alt="pic of brown recluse spider"></a>
            <h3>How do we link to the same page?</h3>

            <p>In order to link to a target on the same page, me must give the target an id</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>&lt;ol&gt;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#top"&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#bottom"Bottom&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p>
            <div>&lt;p id="top"&gt;This is the top of the page!&lt;/p&gt;</div>
            <div>&lt;h1 id="bottom"&gt;This is the bottom! &lt;/h1&gt;</div>
            <p>Note that you put a hashtag in front of the id of the section.</p>

            <h1>What are some tools that developers can use to make code easier to interpret?</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Whitespace
                    <div>-Each element should have it's own line</div>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Indentation
                    <div>-The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends 2 spaces of indentation when writing HTML for easy visualization of elements nested within other elements.
                        Remember that the position of elements in a browser is independent of the amount of whitespace or indentation in the index.html file.</div>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Commenting in code:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Helps you and others to understand your code (especially if you decide to come back and review it at a much later date).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allow you to experiment with new code without having to delete old code.
                    <div>&lt;!-- your comment here --&gt;</div>
                    <div>Or in <strong>visual studio code</strong> you would highlight the comment and then press command / at the same time</div>
                    
                </li>

          <h1>How do you set up at HTML File?</h1>
          <div>In order to let the web browser know we are using HTML we must start out document with a document type declaration that looks like this: </div>
          <div><strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong></div>
          <div>This declaration provides the browser with 2 pieces of information:</div>
          <ol>
            <li>The type of document</li>
            <li>the HTML version to expect</li>
          </ol>
          <div>The declaration doesn't actuallly add any HTML structure or content.</div>
          <p>This must be the first line of code in your HTML document.
            Currently, HTML5 is the most up to date version, but in the future once a new standard has overtaken version 5, beginning with the declaration will make sure that your document is forever interpreted correctly.
            
            Lastly, HTML code always saves in a file with a .html extension.
            
            After you write the declaration, then anything between the &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; will be interpreted as HTML code.</p>

        <section id="head">
            <h1>The Head Element</h1>
            <div>The head element goes above the body element of an html document.  It contains metador for a web page.  Metadata is info about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page. 
            </div>
            <div>A browser's tab displays the title specified in the title tag.  The title tag is always inside of the head tag.</div>
        </section>
        <section id="anchor">
            <h1>The Anchor Tag</h1>
            <div>You can add links to another web page by adding the anchor element and including the text of the link between the opening and closing tags.</div>
            <div>An anchor tag must have and <strong>href</strong> attribute (hyperlink reference) 
                Here's and example:</div>
            <p><strong>&lt;a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"&gt;This Is A Link To Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;</strong></p>
            <p>would display as this: <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">This Is A Link to Wikipedia</a></p>
            <p>Another attribute of the anchor tag in the <strong>target</strong> attribute. The target attribute specifies how a link should open.
                <strong>target="_blank"</strong> to open the link in a new window.
                Leaving out the target attribute will open the link in the same window.</p>
            <p>Here is the same link with a target attribute: <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">This Is A Link to Wikipedia</a></p>
            <h3>When wanting to link to other pages in a static website:</h3>
            <p>Usually web developers store HTML files in the root directory or a main folder where all the files for a project are stored.
                For example let's say that we had this file structure:
            </p>
            <div>project-folder/</div>
            <ul>
                <li>about.html</li>
                <li>contact.html</li>
                <li>index.html</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We can link web pages together using a relative path (shows the path to a local file or a file on the same website. An absolute path is a full url</p>
            <p>Let's say that we are on the index.html and we want to go to the contact page.</p>
            <div><strong>&lt;a href="./contact.html"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;</strong> (would show up as contact underlined as a link)</div>
            <p>The ./ tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder</p>
            <h3>Images as a link</h3>
            <p>You can turn an image into a link by wrapping the image tag in anchor tags</p>
